# Paint-App
Basic Paint app style made in windows forms using C# for school
So yeah, this is just a simple version of the paint app being worked on for a school project.
It's not much design wise since i'm only really focusing on the functionality of it not really trying to make it pretty, but i do know someone out there will make it better.
If you ever have a project like mine, well you're in luck if you ever need the features like i have them for class, just try to learn why it works please.
Lastly, if you have any issues with stuff then let me know via the issues stuff.
